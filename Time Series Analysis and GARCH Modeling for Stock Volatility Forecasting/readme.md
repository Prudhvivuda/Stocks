**Time Series Analysis and GARCH Modeling for Stock Volatility Forecasting**

- **Objective:** Analyzed and forecasted stock volatility using advanced time series models to support quantitative trading strategies.
- **Skills Applied:**
  - **GARCH Modeling:** Developed and implemented Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to forecast stock volatility based on historical price data, leveraging model capabilities to capture volatility clustering.
  - **Predictive Performance Assessment:** Conducted Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) analysis and rolling forecasts to evaluate and refine model performance, ensuring accurate and reliable volatility predictions.
  - **Python Libraries:** Utilized key Python libraries such as `yfinance` for data acquisition, `arch` for advanced volatility modeling, and `statsmodels` for comprehensive time series analysis, contributing to robust and actionable insights.
  - **Quantitative Trading Insights:** Generated data-driven insights to inform and optimize quantitative trading strategies, enhancing decision-making processes and strategy development.
